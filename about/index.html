It will apply to become a CIO (Charitable Incorporated Organisation) and register with Charity Commission later this year.<p>We want to help the homeless in Torbay to achieve homes, jobs and training. We also wish to provide aftercare in their new homes. We will also provide help with benefits doctors and dentists. We will also provide an advocacy service for court and pip tribunals. We are here to help the most vulnerable in society. We will fight poverty and injustice. We are non-political and non-religious, we believe in helping everybody.<p>Everybody at humanity Torbay is here to help as much as we can. We will be working with all agencies and enjoy a warm relationship with the council. We are also supported by the police. We would not be Humanity Torbay if we did not offer outreach service for which we have obtained special permission of the council. And to finish we will also provide love and support. Please support us as we will be providing reading and writing classes, help with higher education and support with work. We believe in helping, we can achieve and this is our ethos.<p>With love to all xx</article></main><footer class="blog-footer content-wrapper"><p>&copy; <span class="full-year"></span> Humanity Torbay</footer><script src="/humanity-torbay/assets/js/scripts.js"></script>
